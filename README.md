MATLAB/Simulink devtool for positioning & control systems: a interactive toolbar that lets engineers plan out simulation path for heavyweight construction vehicles. 

If you don't know how to calculate out realistic (construction-compliant) paths for the vehicle to take (or are just too lazy to), the tool does the math for you.
